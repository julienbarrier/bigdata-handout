# Big Data, statistical learning

I have started writing this handout from the notes I have taken from 
Olivier Rivoireâ€™s course on Big Data and Statistical learning at ESPCI Paris 
from March to April 2018. Please be considerate if some mistakes crop up in
this work.

Introduction and chapter 1 have been processed and are readable.
Chapter 2 and 3 are just raw notes for the moment, read it cautiously.
